In this video, I will show you how to set up your Raspberry Pi by installing Raspbian Lite.

This is the first in a video series about how to get started making things with a raspberry pi. It is targeted at existing developers but will be helpful to you no matter what your background is.

In the next video, we get this thing connected to the Internet and learn how to control the pi wirelessly: [https://youtu.be/hArqrFTq5vQ](https://youtu.be/hArqrFTq5vQ)

For this video, you will need:
* Raspberry pi & its power supply
* Micro sd card with a capacity of at least 8gb is recommended
* Optionally a keyboard, and a monitor. But we're going to learn how to control a pi without these in the next video.
