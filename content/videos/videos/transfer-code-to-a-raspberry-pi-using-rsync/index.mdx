Writing code directly on a raspberry pi is not ideal. It doesn't have our favorite text editor or git installed, and it can be a little bit slow for testing. 

In this video, we're going to learn how to transfer the code we write on our computer, over to the pi, using a tool called rsync.

This is the fifth in a video series about how to get started making things with a raspberry pi. It is targeted at existing developers but will be helpful to you no matter what your background is.
