In this video, I will show you how to connect your raspberry pi to a wifi network and log in to the pi to control it wirelessly using SSH. This is called a headless setup.

This is the second in a video series about how to get started making things with a raspberry pi. It is targeted at existing developers but will be helpful to you no matter what your background is.
