Learn how to setup an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with nginx to accept HTTPS requests.

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-2.html#letsencrypt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SSL-on-amazon-linux-2.html#letsencrypt)

## Setup

First you need to create a new amazon linux 2 ec2 instance with Nginx installed. You can follow one of these videos to get started:

*   [Nginx Reverse Proxy on AWS EC2 Amazon Linux 2: https://youtu.be/\_EBARqreeao](https://youtu.be/_EBARqreeao)
*   [Setting Up And Deploying AWS EC2 Instances: https://youtu.be/GEVbYQWWJkQ](https://youtu.be/GEVbYQWWJkQ)

```shell
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

## DNS

Make sure you have a domain name pointed at the EC2’s ip address. You can follow along with this guide if you’re going to use route53: [https://faun.pub/how-to-migrate-your-domain-to-route53-and-connect-it-to-an-ec2-instance-93698085f0b3](https://faun.pub/how-to-migrate-your-domain-to-route53-and-connect-it-to-an-ec2-instance-93698085f0b3)

Just make sure you can access the ec2 instance on port 80 using a domain name.

Before continuing, stop the nginx service

```shell
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

## Certbot

Certbot is a free, open-source software tool for automatically using Let's Encrypt certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.

*   https://certbot.eff.org/about/

In short, certbot is some software that makes setting up a TLS certificate incredibly easy.

Install certbot on the EC2 instance:

```shell
sudo wget -r --no-parent -A 'epel-release-*.rpm' https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/
sudo rpm -Uvh dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/Packages/e/epel-release-*.rpm
sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel*
sudo yum install -y certbot 
sudo yum install -y python-certbot-nginx
```

Run the following command to setup a TLS certificate for your domain name:

```shell
sudo certbot certonly --standalone --debug -d your.domain.here
```

Replace `your.domain.here` with your actual domain or sub domain.

Once you’ve gone through all of the steps, you should end up with two files in the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain` directory. Of course, always replacing `your.domain` with the actual domain name you used.

*   `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain/privkey.pem`
*   `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain/fullchain.pem`

These files contain the public and private keys needed to create a secure connection with this server. Now we just need to tell nginx to use these when an HTTPS request comes in.

Modify the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file to allow requests on port 443. You can just uncomment the final part of this file and adjust the settings for:

*   `ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain/fullchain.pem";`
*   `ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain/privkey.pem";`
*   `ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;`
*   `ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+3DES:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5;`

Make sure you replace `your.domain` with your actual domain name. Your final server block for port 443 might look something like this:

```nginx
server {
    listen       443 ssl http2;
    listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name  your.domain;

    ssl_certificate "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain/fullchain.pem";
    ssl_certificate_key "/etc/letsencrypt/live/your.domain/privkey.pem";
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+3DES:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5;

    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:1m;
    ssl_session_timeout  10m;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;


    location / {
        proxy_pass http://1.1.1.1:4000;
    }
}
```

Then adjust the port 80 server block to forward HTTP requests to HTTPS requests.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;

  server_name _;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

Restart nginx and test that you can now connect using HTTPS.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
